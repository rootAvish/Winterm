##Cmder for windows power users.
This is a for of user @dufferzafar's [Commander](https://github.com/dufferzafar/Cmder) , won't show as a fork since i just copied the files onto my computer.

originally a fork of the awesome [Cmder](https://github.com/bliker/cmder/) project.

The original didn't seem to work so well for me , due to its heavy reliance on AutoHotkey( which as of february 2014 is not perfected on windows 8).

I've retained the "msysgit", "gow", "putty", "vim" packages (in the vendor folder).Credit for integrating them into the package goes to @dufferzafar  of course .

See the ".gitignore" file for the entire structure.
