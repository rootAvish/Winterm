# Cmder

Latest release is **[v1.1.2](https://github.com/bliker/cmder/releases/tag/v1.1.2)**

Cmder is a **software package** created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based on [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/) with *major* config overhaul. Monokai color scheme, amazing [clink](https://code.google.com/p/clink/) and custom prompt layout.

## Why use it

The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally self-contained with no external dependencies, that is makes it great for **USB Sticks** or **Dropbox**. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
1. Extract
1. (optional) Place files into `bin` folder, it will be injected into your PATH.
1. Run cmder

*(There will be a version with installer)*

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Tab manipulation

* `Ctrl + t` : new tab dialog (maybe you want to open cmd as admin?)
* `Ctrl + w` : close tab
* `Ctrl + d` : close tab (if pressed on empty command)
* `Ctrl + alt + number` : fast new tab: `1` - CMD, `2` - Powershell `*` - More to come
* `Alt + enter`: Fullscreen

### Shell

* `Shift + Up` : Traverse up in directory structure (lovely feature!)
* `End, Home, Ctrl` : Traversing text with as usual on Windows
* `Ctrl + r` : History search
* `Shift + mouse` : Select and copy text from buffer

(Some shortcuts are not yet documented, thought they exist, please add them here)

## Features

For example there is one defined for you `alias e.=explorer .`

All aliases will be saved in `/config/aliases` file
